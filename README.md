# Incapsula
some random Incapsula deobfuscation effort

# Main
Decoded file shows there is an array with some encoded strings. They are base64 encoding and using RC4 with an encryption key

# Next
Next step would be to get the encryption key through live browser debugging, then it's possible to deobfuscate further
